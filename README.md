# ColorManRun

Status: *frozen*

It's a simple hypercasual game for Android. Gameplay is supposed to be based on colors/color matching.
Also the game might be ported to WebGL.

### About project & code
Now it's example of my code abilities.
*Project does not contain any architecture frameworks as Zenject & ECS on purpose.*

Also project contains unimplemented in game code which works with NavMeshComponents & spawning enemies.
